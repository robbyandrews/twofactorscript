# twofactorscript
Collection of sed commands to enable two factor authentication in SmartOS

### Which one do I use?
If you use pkgsrc to install the Google Authenticator module, then `twofactorpkgsrc.sh` is the script to use.

If you build and install from source then use `twofactorsource.sh`.  pkgsrc installs the libraries to a different location than when building from source.
